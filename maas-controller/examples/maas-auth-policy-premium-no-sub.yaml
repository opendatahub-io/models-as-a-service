# MaaSAuthPolicy for the premium simulator: access only, NO subscription.
# Users in premium-viewer can pass auth but have no token quota (no MaaSSubscription).
# They will get 429 from the per-route TRLP's deny-unsubscribed rule (if another
# subscription exists for the same model).
# Use this to see "policy without subscription" behavior.
# Replace "premium-viewer" with a group from your identity provider (TokenReview).
